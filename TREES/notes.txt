treee- heirarchial and linear data structure

components of treee
  node, leaf node, root, edge, subtree, height, size, depth

binary search treee-
  a tree whose elements have atmost 2 children
   namely left and right

max no of nodes at level i- 2^i

max no of nodes in a tree with height h- 2^h-1

if n-nodes, then n-1 edges

left child - 2*i
right child- 2*i+1
parent -i/2

Build tree- Binary Tree representation 
(1) define a class node
(2) make a class binary tree
(3) make a function for building tree that will return node
(4) now we will traverse the nodes[] array index wise aur help se nodes banani hain
     static idx=-1
   -> har node pe index update ho rha hain 
    -> so after starting the function only update the index i.e idx++;
(5) after making that new Node , we have to make its left and right subtree
